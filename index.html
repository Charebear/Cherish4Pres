-Cherish C. Goldsby </h2> <hr>
<p>	    As President of Norview High School's Senior class, I have plans to make this year the most inclusive for every senior. Because I have prior experience from being the Vice President of the class of 2018 for the past two years, I already have the background knowledge to get right down to business as soon as I get back in office. With new ideas as well as a listening ear, I will make sure that everything that is done for the class of 2018 suits our interests and is beneficial to our class as a whole. i have heard from the public that the student council hasn't done their best to make decisions for our class. So, I plan to do polls via the Class of 2018 Facebook page and Remind app through Ms. Rosario. The events once left at the hands of only the council will be decided as an entire class if I am given the honor of becoming your president. For the 2017-2018 school year, it wll be my TOP PRIORITY that everyone has a voice!</p>
<p>	    Running for Senior class President is a title that comes with stupendous amounts of responsibility and I'm that responsible person for the job. I've always been complimented for my work ethic and ability to multitask all while being able to depend on when I'm needed. As said prior, it will be my top priority to ensure everyone's voice be heard concerning our class. My social media (listed below) will be checked regularly if there are any questions or concerns about senior year. Also, I will set up a regular schedule to put up and take down posters around the school of important dates and information for seniors. This is a year that we have to be organized in and I'm the one that can keep us on the ball! who else would you trust to ensure a successful senior year? Vote Cherish Goldsby to be your president! </p>
